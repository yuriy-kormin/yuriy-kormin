Hello! My name is Yuriy. I've been interested in programming since school, but lately I've been doing it thoroughlyüëÄ<p>
  I <a href="https://ru.hexlet.io/u/tork">successfully completed</a> Python developer course at <a href = https://en.hexlet.io/u/tork>Hexlet</a> <p>üå±
During my student days, I worked as a system administrator / helpdesc in a small office with 25 employees and 2 servers on Alt Linux (routing, traffic counting, internal site)<p>
I rent a couple of VPS on Ubuntu (zabbix, apache+php+mysql, backup, wireguard). They have several business card sites of my frinds<p>
Tried myself in arduino / raspberry pi (IoT) for homemade. Of the achievements - a home-made solid fuel boiler control system using several stepper motors and a relay to turn off / turn off ventilation. This made in python with multithreading elements. The Zabbix monitoring system was connected to this whole thing. More details can be found in my profile at <a href = "https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~013e3d9819e16cfade?s=1110580753891577856">upwork</a>(need to register)<p>
I live in Batumi, Georgia<p>
Actively looking for a job (internship) in the field of backend in python (mostly remote plan)
